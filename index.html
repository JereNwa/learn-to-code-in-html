<md>## Hey there!

JereNwa here. If you were wondering how I made this website, then you're not the only one!

I used a programming language called HTML!

## Before we start...

Here are the things you will need:

* A computer (Windows or macOS)
* A text or code editor

Suggestions:

Text editor - Notepad or TextEdit for Windows or macOS, respectively.
Code editor - Visual Studio Code for both Windows and macOS.

**Always remember to keep filename extensions ticked and to end the filename with _.html_.**

## Part One: The Basics

To learn HTML, we're going to have to start with the basics.

Below is a simple piece of HTML code:


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Basic Website</title>
<body>
<p>This is a HTML test.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
And [this](example-1.html) is what it produces.

I'm now going to break down the code.

The `!DOCTYPE html` declaration is at the start of every piece of HTML code. It tells the browser what document type to expect.
Next is the `html` tag. It's the root of an HTML document, containing all code in the document.(excluding the `!DOCTYPE html` declaration.)

Before we move on, I need to talk a bit about tags.
